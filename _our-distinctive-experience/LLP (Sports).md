<br>Provides a safe and inclusive environment for all pupils regardless of
their strengths and starting points to try out and participate in the different
types of games and modified games. This is in line with the nationwide
initiative to promote healthy lifestyle amongst Singaporeans. Research
studies have shown that getting children to be more active has benefits,
as obesity rates among schoolchildren have risen in recent years, from
10 per cent in 2000 to 12 per cent in 2014.&nbsp; Special games and/or
mass exercises are organised to encourage pupils of all levels to take
part. Sports equipment are available for loan during recess to encourage
self-directed and ‘unstructured’ play.</p>
