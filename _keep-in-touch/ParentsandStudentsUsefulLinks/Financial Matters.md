#### NEU PC Plus Programme

Students from low income households who wish to own a new computer at a subsidised price can apply for one under the NEU PC Plus Programme administered by Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). Under this Programme, each eligible household may apply for one subsidised computer once every 3 years, regardless of the number of school-going children or household members with permanent disabilities.

For parents who wish to apply, please indicate so in Section V. If your application for MOE FAS is successful, the school will provide you with a form to apply for enrolment under the NEU PC Plus Programme and help you to send the completed form to the lead agencies appointed by IMDA for processing and approval.
