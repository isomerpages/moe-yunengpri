<h1>Welcome Message by Principal</h1>

Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are a key component of the holistic development of our students. Through CCAs, our students discover their interests and talents. CCAs also help our students to learn values and develop their character, social emotional competencies and skills to prepare them for future challenges.  CCAs bring students from diverse backgrounds together. By learning and interacting with one another, students develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to the school and community.

We are excited that you are now given the opportunity to be part of our CCAs @ Yu Neng.  We wish you all the very best as you make your choice to join one of these CCAs!  May you continue to grow and discover yourself through the enriching experiences offered as you contribute by giving your best to the CCA you will be part of.
