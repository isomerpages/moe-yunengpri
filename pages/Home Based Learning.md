## Home Based Learning

Starting from 19 October 2023, Yu Neng Primary School students will shift to Home Based Learning (HBL) till 20 October 2023.<br>

Students need not report to school starting fro 19 October 2023 to 20 October 2023 and are expected to stay at home to engage in planned online and offline learning activites. Students are strongly encouraged to follow the proposed learning timetable. <br>

Teachers will monitor students' learning progress and provide the necessary support i.e. providing feedback through the online platforms. They will also contact the students via Class Dojo or phone call to check in with their students and monitor how they are coping with HBL. <br>
