## Home Based Learning

Starting from ___________, Yu Neng Primary School students will shift to Home Based Learning (HBL) until further notice.<br>

Teachers will monitor students' learning progress and provide the necessary support i.e. providing feedback through the online platforms. They will also contact the students via Class Dojo or phone call to check in with their students and monitor how they are coping with HBL. <br>
