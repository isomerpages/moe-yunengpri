## Home Based Learning

To better equip our students with the skills necessary for independent learning and to prepare them for potential future disruptions, all students will participate in our E-Learning Day on&nbsp;**Monday, 26 May 2025**.<br>

Through this E-Learning experience, students will:

a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhance Readiness for E-Learning: By practicing home-based learning, students will be better prepared to adapt to prolonged school closures, while helping the school address any logistical or technological challenges.

b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultivate Self-Directed Learning Skills: Students will learn to manage their time effectively, take ownership of their learning, and seek assistance when needed within a digital environment.

c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appreciate the Role of Technology in Learning: Students will experience first-hand how technology can support and enrich learning, collaboration, and communication beyond the traditional classroom. <br>

Teachers will monitor students' learning progress and provide the necessary support i.e. providing feedback through the online platforms. <br>
