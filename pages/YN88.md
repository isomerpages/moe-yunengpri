| Yu Neng is 88 Years Old This Year! |  |
| -------- | -------- |
|Yu Neng Primary School was established in 1935 by its early founders with the aim to do whatever it takes so that the children in the villages could have better lives than their elders. 88 years on, and nestled in the heart of Bedok, we have established ourselves as a school of choice, with distinctive programmes particularly in the areas of ICT (ALP) and Sports (LLP) to support the holistic development of students from diverse backgrounds. This year, we are very happy to celebrate our 88th anniversary.|

|![](/images/YN88-logo-final.png)  |To celebrate our 88th anniversary this year, we are pleased to share our celebratory logo as shown on the left. It was creatively designed by our PSG Vice-chairperson, Ms Jessica Wong. The number ‘88’ represented by two interweaved ‘8’ signifies continuity seen in our long and rich history which is made possible with the relentless support of our SAC, Alumni, ex-students and parents.|
