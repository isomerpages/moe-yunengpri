Eating healthily is one of the key messages we share with our students in Yu Neng, reiterating the importance of having a balanced diet. Through our ***Health Education*** lessons, students also learn more about the benefits of eating healthily. To further promote healthy living and eating, the school organises Health Awareness Week to promote health awareness and organised interesting activities to engage our students. In conjunction with the ***Health Awareness week***, we also have a Fruit Day where students are strongly encouraged to consume their fruits during recess and reiterate the importance of eating fruits.

Working closely with our school canteen vendors, we strive to serve quality food in accordance to the “***My Healthy Plate***” initiative by the Health Promotion Board. We hope to instil good eating habits in our students at an early age.

#### What is my Healthy Plate?

No single food can provide all the nutrients that your body needs. That is why you need to eat a wide variety of foods in the right amounts to meet your daily nutritional needs. But eating healthier, balanced meals does not have to be complicated.
