PAL in Yu Neng aims to nurture students to be passionate, caring and engaged learners. We hope to develop in each child  a curious mind about their environment and build a positive attitude towards learning. Students are provided with different learning experiences and opportunities to develop the 21 CC competencies and social and emotional competencies.During PAL Visual Art lessons, students explore ideas using art materials and learn creative ways to share and work in their teams.  For PAL Drama lessons, students work in groups to enact a given scenario or take the perspective of a character in the story to solve a problem. PAL Music lessons encourage students to engage in musical games and to enjoy creative music making with musical instruments. For the Sports and Games PAL module, students learn the importance of teamwork when playing team games and creating their own games to share with their friends. Outdoor Education skills such as map reading, pacing, first aid and tent pitching equip pupils with skills for the great outdoors and at the same time provide students opportunities to cooperate, work together and listen to one another’s opinions in a fun way.  At the end of every lesson, time is allocated for students to express their thoughts and reflect on their learning experiences.
