<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>We nurture <strong>informed, concerned, and participative citizens</strong> by
empowering students to become <strong>confident, self-directed learners</strong> who
understand their place in Singapore and the world.
<br>This foundation serves as a vital prelude to post-primary humanities learning.
By fostering critical inquiry, and cross-cultural and global awareness,
we prepare students to navigate a complex world with empathy and insight
beyond their primary years.</p>
<h4>Why Social Studies matters</h4>
<p>Social Studies develops informed, concerned, and participative citizens.
By exploring Singapore’s identity and global connections, students learn
to appreciate diverse perspectives and understand their personal and collective
responsibilities toward the nation’s future.</p>

<h4>The Yu Neng Difference</h4>
<p>What sets the Social Studies programme at Yu Neng Primary School apart
is the deliberate shift from <strong>content consumption</strong> to <strong>active inquiry</strong>.
While the standard curriculum covers facts and figures, Yu Neng emphasises <strong>real-world learning,</strong> ensuring
students do not just "know" Social Studies – they "experience" it.</p>
