The curriculum prepares our students to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to understand the interconnectedness in Singapore and the world they live in. Our students will be encouraged to inquire real-world issues that concern their lives. This is to help them attain relevant knowledge and understandings of these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate different perspectives. The curriculum also seeks to inculcate in students the values that define the Singaporean society and nurture dispositions to show concern for the world they live in and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.

			Authentic learning experience forms part of the teaching and learning of Social Studies. In Yu Neng, each year, students participate in field-based learning through learning journeys that take them to places like the museums and heritage trails. These experiences strengthen students’ understanding and appreciation of Singapore and enable them to make connections between knowledge learnt with real, authentic experiences. During the Covid-19 pandemic, our students went on virtual learning journeys locally and regionally.
