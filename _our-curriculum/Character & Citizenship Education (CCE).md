### CHARACTER &amp; CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION (CCE)

#### Objectives / Goals

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is an integral part in developing our students to be caring leaders, who are socially and emotionally competent, anchored in our school’s GR<sup>3</sup>IT values and future ready, and will make a positive impact to the community. The school thus takes a holistic approach to CCE, seeking to integrate the cognitive with the affective and social aspects of education.

| Components of CCE | What it is |
|---|---|
| What Went Well (WWW) | To inculcate good habits as well as to allow for students’ voice |
| Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) | Teaching of social emotional competencies, building of Teacher-Student Relationship and Peer Support Relationship |
| CCE | Teaching of knowledge, skills and values for CCE in Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) |
| School-based CCE programmes | Assembly programmes that are linked to school wide programmes |
| Education Career Guidance (ECG) | Enabling students to discover their strengths, the different occupations in the economy and to explore viable education and career options |
| Sexuality Education (SEd) | Enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions in their growing up years |

#### Key Programmes

<h5><u>Character &amp; Leadership Development</u></h5>

The core GR<sup>3</sup>IT values are fundamental for a person of good character and a useful citizen of Singapore. The values guide students to discern between right and wrong and help them make responsible choices. Students are nurtured to be leaders of self and others, thereby preparing them to be leaders of tomorrow.

<h5><u>Values-in-Action (VIA)</u></h5>

To establish an effective learning environment, spaces are created for their voices to be heard, providing opportunities for them to develop self-directedness, responsibility and ownership of their learning. Through VIAs, opportunities are provided for students to participate in the planning and implementation of the projects, thereby developing a sense of belonging to the school community and beyond, and having the motivation to make a positive difference.

Yu Neng Primary School Mother Tongue Language Teachers in collaboration with our Character
and Citizenship Education department has put together the F.A.M.I.L.Y. (Father And Mother I
Love You) @YN initiative. This initiative aims to bring in real world context to learning and
imbued in students a sense of gratitude for the role their families play in shaping who they are
and who they become. Through this, we hope students not only extend their learning beyond
the classrooms, but also grow to appreciate and value family relationships more.
