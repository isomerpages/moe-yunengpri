<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p><strong>Nurturing Passionate, Creative and Caring Learners of the Arts</strong>
<br>Our aesthetics programme is dedicated to developing students who approach
the arts with passion, creativity and compassion. We believe that artistic
education extends beyond technical skill development to encompass the cultivation
of empathetic, innovative thinkers who can contribute meaningfully to society
through their creative endeavours.</p>
<p>Through our comprehensive arts curriculum, students discover their artistic
voices whilst developing critical thinking skills and cultural awareness.
Our approach emphasises both individual expression and collaborative learning,
fostering an environment where creativity flourishes alongside personal
growth and social responsibility.</p>
<h4>Why Art matters</h4>
<p>Our art programme recognises the fundamental role of visual arts in developing
well-rounded, culturally literate individuals. We are committed to fostering
deep engagement with artistic practice whilst nurturing students' creative
capabilities and cultural understanding.</p>
<p>We cultivate students who approach art with genuine passion and sustained
curiosity, viewing creative exploration as both a personal journey and
a means of connecting with the broader world. Our programme emphasises
the intrinsic value of artistic expression in developing empathy, critical
thinking, and cultural awareness.</p>
<p>Through comprehensive art education, students acquire sophisticated understanding
of artistic concepts, techniques, and historical contexts. They develop
proficiency in visual communication, learning to express complex ideas
and emotions with clarity, purpose, and artistic integrity.</p>
<p>Central to our approach is the connection between artistic practice and
contemporary society. Students create meaningful work that reflects their
understanding of cultural contexts and social issues, developing the ability
to interpret and respond to the world around them through their artistic
practice.</p>
<p>Our programme nurtures critical thinking skills that extend beyond the
art classroom, preparing students to engage thoughtfully with visual culture
and contribute meaningfully to their communities through creative expression
and cultural understanding.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Why Music Matters</strong></h4>
<p>Our music programme recognises music as a universal language that transcends
cultural boundaries and enriches human experience. We are dedicated to
providing comprehensive musical education that develops both technical
proficiency and deep appreciation for the transformative power of music
in personal and community life.</p>
<p>Through our three core pillars of listening, creating, and performing,
students acquire essential musical skills, knowledge, and theoretical understanding
that establish a solid foundation for lifelong musical engagement. We believe
that musical literacy is fundamental to cultural participation and personal
expression in our interconnected world.</p>
<p>Central to our approach is the development of students' creative expression
and communication abilities through music. We encourage exploration of
individual artistic voices whilst systematically building confidence in
both musical performance and composition, enabling students to communicate
emotions, ideas, and experiences through sound.</p>
<p>Our programme cultivates profound appreciation for music across local
and global cultures, fostering understanding of diverse musical traditions
and their cultural significance. This multicultural perspective develops
respect for different artistic expressions whilst broadening students'
musical horizons and cultural awareness.</p>
<p>We are committed to nurturing musical curiosity and passion that extends
far beyond formal education. Our ultimate aspiration is to develop musically
literate individuals who actively contribute to the cultural vitality of
their communities, whether as performers, composers, informed listeners,
or advocates for the arts.</p>

<h4>Our Key Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Digital Art Story-telling through Stop-Motion Animation and Photography</strong>
<br>Our comprehensive digital art programme integrates traditional artistic
techniques with contemporary digital media, providing students with essential
skills for creative expression in the modern world. Through carefully structured
progression across year levels, students develop both technical proficiency
and conceptual understanding of digital storytelling methods.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 4 Digital Art Exhibition</strong>
<br>Primary 4 students utilise Keynote software to create distinctive surrealist
artworks, exploring the intersection of imagination and digital design.
This programme extends beyond creation to include curatorial thinking,
as students engage in critical reflection about exhibition presentation
and audience engagement. They develop understanding of how digital art
functions within gallery contexts whilst building foundational skills in
digital design and presentation software.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 5 Stop-Motion Animation</strong>
<br>Primary 5 students engage in sophisticated storytelling through stop-motion
animation, seamlessly blending traditional paper art techniques with digital
media production. This programme develops sequential thinking, narrative
construction, and technical skills in animation software whilst maintaining
connection to hands-on artistic practices. Students learn to plan, create,
and edit their animated stories, developing patience, attention to detail,
and understanding of time-based media.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 6 Photography and Land Art</strong>
<br>Primary 6 students advance their visual literacy through comprehensive
photography and land art projects using iPads. This programme develops
both technical photography skills and environmental awareness as students
explore the relationship between art and nature. They learn composition
principles, digital editing techniques, and documentation methods whilst
creating temporary installations that respond to natural environments.
This initiative fosters appreciation for environmental stewardship alongside
artistic expression, preparing students to engage thoughtfully with both
digital media and ecological contexts.</p>

of our school community, celebrating both individual achievement and shared
cultural learning.</p>

<h4>Our Yu Neng Difference</h4>
<p><strong>Digital Art Integration</strong>
<br>Our comprehensive digital art programme seamlessly integrates technology
with creative expression across multiple year levels. Students engage in
interdisciplinary projects that combine art, information and communication
technology, and subject-specific learning objectives.</p>
<p>In our innovative Cantonese opera project, students design traditional
accessories for Cody Rocky robots before programming them to perform choreographed
dances, merging cultural heritage with modern technology.</p>
<p>Our Primary 4 students collaborate across Social Studies and ICT to create
original characters using Scratch, developing both digital design skills
and coding proficiency to produce engaging infographic presentations.</p>
<p>Our Primary 5 students participate in an innovative interdisciplinary
project that seamlessly integrates visual arts with scientific inquiry
through the Science Rice Planting Project. This comprehensive initiative
demonstrates our commitment to connecting artistic practice with real-world
applications and environmental learning.</p>
<p>Students engage in the complete design and construction process of creating
scarecrows, developing both artistic and practical skills. Through this
hands-on project, they learn fundamental textile techniques including design
planning, pattern creation, and sewing methods, whilst applying their understanding
of form, function, and aesthetic principles.</p>
