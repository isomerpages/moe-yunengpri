#### KEY PROGRAMMES

<b>A) Growing Minds, Growing Hearts</b> <br>
 Growing Minds, Growing Hearts is a Science department 6 year programme to groom students to be stewards of the environment in promoting green efforts towards a more sustainable future. This is to ensure that the Earth and all of its resources can continue to provide a home for people, animals and plants.

				EXPOSE P1 and P2<br>
				Integration of Science into P1 and P2 STELLAR
			</b>
			<br><br>
			The Science in STELLAR Programme is a collaboration with the English department to infuse Science with learning English. Themes include “A Butterfly is Born”, “What Will the Weather Be Like Today?”, and “The Enormous Watermelon”. Cross-disciplinary activities are used to engage learners in the classroom and arouse their interests in Science and the world around them, before they start learning Science at P3.

				EXTEND P3 and P4 <br>
				P3 Every Child A Seed Programme <br> 
				P4 Vegetable Planting for the Community
			</b>
			<br><br>
			Students’ involvement are extended to hands on activities by them planting their own plants. P3 students will get their own pots, soil and seeds from Nparks and learn about the Plant System during Science lessons. While P4 students will also grow vegetables from seeds before transplanting them into the vegetable plots in our very own eco garden. They will learn not only on life cycle of plants but they will also be harvesting the vegetables they have planted and distributing them to the community.
			<br>
			It is a way giving back to the community by showing our care and emphathy with the others.

<b>B) Learning Journeys</b><br>
Science learning takes place beyond the classroom. Besides at one learning trails at our school Multi-Sensory Ecogarden from P3 to P6 levels, students also explore other places to foster stronger connections between real-life experiences and its application in Science questions.

			<b>P1 and P2 Learning Journeys to the Singapore Science Centre</b>
			<br><br>
			Our P1 and P2 students visit the Singapore Science Centre and engage in hands-on activities via workshops to learn more about the garden habitat (P1) and the world of insects (P2). These experiences concretise what they learn in the STELLAR curriculum and arouse their interest and curiosity about their environment.
