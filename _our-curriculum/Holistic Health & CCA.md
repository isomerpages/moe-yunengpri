#### Scope & Sequence of Primary Level Syllabus

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">The lower primary level focuses on the teaching and mastery of fundamental motor skills and concepts. Through the learning areas of athletics, dance, games and sports, gymnastics, and swimming, the foundation of specific movement patterns is laid. In this way, students have numerous opportunities to reinforce their movement, and learn new skills and understanding, as they practise and transfer skills and understanding across multiple areas to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their performance.</td>
