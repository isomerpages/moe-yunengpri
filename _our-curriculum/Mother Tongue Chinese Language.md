<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<p>Our Mother Tongue Languages programme offers a rich and engaging range
of activities designed to develop language proficiency while nurturing
cultural understanding and 21st-century competencies. Students participate
in a variety of language-focused activities, including Library Week, MTL
SOAR (Reading programme), and language competitions, to strengthen their
literacy, communication, and creative thinking skills. Beyond the classroom,
students immerse themselves in cultural and festival celebrations, such
as Chinese New Year, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Chinese Cultural Camp, where
they engage in traditional activities like lion dances, lantern-making
with watercolours, etc during these festivities. These experiences make
learning vibrant and interactive, fostering values such as respect, collaboration,
gratitude, and a sense of community. Special learning spaces such as the
Multilingual Hub further enhance learning, providing visual and exploratory
environments where students can connect with their Mother Tongue Language,
culture, and values in meaningful and interactive ways. Through these programmes,
our Mother Tongue Languages curriculum nurtures future-ready, confident,
and culturally grounded learners who are proficient in language and deeply
appreciative of their heritage.</p>
