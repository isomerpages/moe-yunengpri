			Students are selected to embark on Cultural Immersion Programs to China and / or Taiwan. Besides visiting historical and significant places of interest, the highlight of the program was the school immersion experience with the Chinese Primary School. Our students forged strong friendships with their Chinese counterparts as they attended lessons together and learnt together through different cultural enrichment programs such as calligraphy lesson and pottery lesson. Students have learnt to be independent and demonstrated the spirit of GR3IT values during the trip.<br>

Despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic, we continue to provide our students with meaningful cultural exchange with students from Beijing Doudian Primary School (北京窦店小学) virtually, where students learnt about the history and culture of each other.
