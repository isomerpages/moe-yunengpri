<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>We empower every student to become a critical reader, confident communicator,
and purposeful writer. Through our vibrant EL &amp; SS curriculums, we
nurture curiosity and literacy, equipping learners to express ideas with
purpose, clarity and intent. We inspire a lifelong love for the English
language and humanities, preparing every child to navigate the world with
confidence.</p>
<h4>Why English Language matters</h4>
<p>The acquisition of English Language skills plays an important role in:
<br>- developing students to communicate with empathy,
<br>- read with discernment and
<br>- inquire with creativity.</p>
<p>Students are also able to use standard English effectively to engage with
others, generate meaning, develop critical thinking, and contribute to
society.</p>

<h4>The Yu Neng Difference</h4>
<p>At Yu Neng Primary School, the English Language curriculum distinguishes
itself by shifting the focus from classroom theory to <strong>meaningful real-life application</strong>.
Our approach ensures that every skill learnt is immediately put into practice
within authentic contexts.</p>
<p>By grounding the curriculum in the <strong>PACC framework (Purpose, Audience, Context, and Culture)</strong>,
we move beyond textbook exercises. Whether it is through the <strong>Flat Stanley</strong> and <strong>Project Pen Pal</strong> initiatives—where
writing becomes a tool for genuine social connection—or the <strong>Say it in 90s</strong> platform
that develops real-world oratorical confidence, our students learn that
language is a powerful vehicle for influence. This emphasis on "learning
by doing" transforms students into purposeful communicators who can navigate
diverse audiences and real-world challenges with ease.</p>
