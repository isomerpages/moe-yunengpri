			<b><u>World Class@YN - Staying Current@YN</u></b><br>
			<br>The WorldClass@YN – Staying Current@YN programme seeks to bring the world into the classrooms by introducing people and cultures from around the world to our students. This helps students to develop intercultural, social and global awareness.<br>
<br>
The programme consists of The Flat Stanley Project, Staying Current@YN and Contemporary Issues@YN. <br>
<br>
Through The Flat Stanley Project, P2 and P3 students take the book character, Flat Stanley, on different adventures and outings and share these experiences with friends locally and overseas by writing letters and emails. <br>
<br>
P4 to P6 students subscribe to a student news publication, What’s Up, to discuss contemporary issues that matter to them and others.<br>
<br>
Students also acquire multiliteracies when they analyse texts, pictures and videos.
