#### Scope &amp; Sequence of Primary Level Syllabus

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td colspan="3">The lower primary level focuses on the teaching and mastery of fundamental motor skills and concepts. Through the learning areas of athletics, dance, games and sports, gymnastics, and swimming, the foundation of specific movement patterns is laid. In this way, students have numerous opportunities to reinforce their movement, and learn new skills and understanding, as they practise and transfer skills and understanding across multiple areas to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their performance.</td>

		The <b>upper primary</b> level builds on students’ development in the lower primary. There is further refinement of basic movement patterns, and the&nbsp;<b>development of combined skills to help them move with increasing complexity, variety, and versatility to take on more challenging movement activities and tasks.</b> Students, therefore, develop the more complex and specialised movement skills that are needed for sports and other physical activities. Specifically for games and sports, the games-related concepts such as ‘use of space’, ‘maintain possession’, ‘create attack’, ‘organise defence’ and ‘defend space and bases’ are articulated within the various categories of territorial-invasion, net-barrier, and striking-fielding games. <br><br>
