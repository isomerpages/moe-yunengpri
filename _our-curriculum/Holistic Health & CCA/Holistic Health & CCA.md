<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>To provide inclusive and engaging sporting experiences that develop students’
skills, character, and teamwork, while nurturing healthy habits and values
of respect, resilience, and sportsmanship.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Why Holictic Health &amp; CCA matters</h4>
<p>We aim to develop students’ motor skills by exposing them to a wide variety
of physical activities, enabling them to participate confidently and competently
across different contexts. Through these experiences, students are provided
with opportunities to demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily
activities, showing respect for themselves, others, and the environment.
The programme also seeks to educate and promote positive personal and social
behaviours, while encouraging students to acquire and maintain health-enhancing
fitness through regular participation in physical activities, so that they
can enjoy and value the benefits of leading a physically active and healthy
life.</p>

<p>The lower primary level focuses on the teaching and mastery of fundamental
motor skills and concepts. Through the learning areas of athletics, dance,
games and sports, gymnastics, and swimming, the foundation of specific
movement patterns is laid. In this way, students have numerous opportunities
to reinforce their movement, and learn new skills and understanding, as
they practise and transfer skills and understanding across multiple areas
to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in their performance.</p>

<p>The <strong>upper primary</strong> level builds on students’ development
in the lower primary. There is further refinement of basic movement patterns,
and the&nbsp;<strong>development of combined skills to help them move with increasing complexity, variety, and versatility to take on more challenging movement activities and tasks.</strong> Students,
therefore, develop the more complex and specialised movement skills that
are needed for sports and other physical activities. Specifically for games
and sports, the games-related concepts such as ‘use of space’, ‘maintain
possession’, ‘create attack’, ‘organise defence’ and ‘defend space and
bases’ are articulated within the various categories of territorial-invasion,
net-barrier, and striking-fielding games.
