### MATHEMATICS

#### Objectives / Goals

<h5><u> Vision </u></h5>

*   Every Child and Every Teacher A Creative Problem Solver

<h5><u> Objectives </u></h5>

*   To cultivate passion in the learning of Mathematics
*   To develop in each child an ability to select and decide on the best mathematical approach to problem solving.

####  Primary Mathematics Framework

**The Primary Mathematics Syllabus aims to enable all students to:**

*   acquire mathematical _concepts and skills for everyday use_ and for continuous learning in Mathematics.
*   develop _thinking, reasoning, communication, application and meta-cognitive skills_ through a mathematical approach to problem-solving.
*   build _confidence_ and _foster interest_ in Mathematics.

#### YN Mathematics Curriculum Framework

**4 Key Considerations in Designing Mathematics Lessons:**

1\.  Develop relational understanding. <br>
2\.  Involve students as active learners. <br>
3\.  Provide ample opportunities for success in Mathematics. <br>
4\.  Create an inviting and vibrant environment for learning.

			E2K is a Mathematics enrichment programme for upper primary students who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics.<br>
			<br>
The programme comprises Mathematics curriculum units that are designed to challenge high-ability students and to introduce them to advanced Mathematics concepts and thinking.   It fosters independence in mathematical thinking skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies such as creative and critical thinking and effective communication skills.<br>
			<br>
During the E2K sessions, students will be assigned challenging Mathematics problems. They will have opportunities to discover, reason and communicate mathematical ideas and concepts, especially in problem solving (games-based learning).

			Students experience real life application of mathematical  knowledge as they apply their understanding of geometry in the process of constructing a kite. This event not only deepens mathematical understanding of students, but strengthens recall and process thinking skills through hands-on involvement in the kite construction. Apart from being engaging and fun, true joy is also elicited through seeing their newly constructed  kite soar high in the sky.
