<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>Every Teacher Inspires and Every Child Aspires to Excel and become an
Effective Problem Solver</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Why Mathematics matters</h4>
<p>Mathematics is more than numbers. It develops the thinking, reasoning,
and problem-solving skills that students need for meaningful learning and
real-world application.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To develop enduring understanding in Mathematics by connecting key concepts
to real-world contexts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To build confidence in problem solving by equipping students with structured
thinking routines that support clear mathematical thinking and reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To nurture critical thinkers and strengthen metacognitive skills through
activity-based learning, conceptual development, and higher-order problem-solving
approaches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Our Key Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Annual Mathematics Week</strong>
</p>
<p>Mathematics Beyond the Classroom @ Math Week is an annual one-week programme
designed to bring the joy of learning Mathematics to our students through
a variety of purposeful and fun-filled experiences.</p>
<p>This programme is guided by three key principles:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meaningful use of curriculum
time</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning beyond the
four walls of the classroom</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A safe and supportive
learning environment</p>
<p>Math Week activities are anchored on enriching students’ learning through
knowledge expansion, enabling the application of mathematical theories
to practice, and empowering students to see how mathematical concepts are
used in everyday life.</p>
<p>Highlights of Math Week include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gallery walk featuring
student-created artefacts and mathematical works</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Puzzle-based challenges
that promote logical thinking and perseverance</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun recess games and
activities, including interactive Kahoot! quizzes</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hands-on puzzle play
to encourage exploration and problem-solving</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engaging classroom activities
involving origami, Strawbies, and MatheMagic</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathematics insights
and learning beyond the Primary Mathematics textbook, shared during pre-morning
assemblies</p>
<p>Through these experiences, students develop a deeper appreciation of Mathematics
as a meaningful and relevant discipline.</p>
