### MATHEMATICS

#### Objectives / Goals

<h5><u> Vision </u></h5>

* Every Teacher Inspires and Every Child Aspires to Excel and become an Effective Problem Solver

<h5><u> Objectives </u></h5>

* To enable enduring understanding in the study of Mathematics by linking topical knowledge with real world context.
* To instil confidence in the application of mathematical skills for problem solving through the use of a structure process comprising&nbsp; thinking routines to develop the students’ schema for mathematical thinking and&nbsp; reasoning.
* To build critical thinkers and strengthen metacognition through the use of activity base learning for conceptual development and the application of higher order problem solving approaches.

#### YN Mathematics Curriculum Framework

**5 Key Considerations in Designing Mathematics Lessons:**

1\.  Develop relational understanding. <br>
2\.  Involve students as active learners. <br>
3\.  Experiential Learning to strengthen thinking and reasoning skills <br>
4\.  Ensure relevance by blending with digital millennial
5\.  Build metacognitive skills through inculcating a reflective disposition<br><br>

#### Syllabus

[2013&nbsp;MOE Mathematics Syllabus (Primary 5 &amp; 6)](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/syllabuses/sciences/files/mathematics_syllabus_primary_1_to_6.pdf)<br>
[2021 MOE Mathematics Sullabus (P1 - P4)](https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/syllabus/2021-pri-mathematics-1-to-3.pdf)


#### Key Programmes

<b><u>The Thinking Routine</u></b><br>
This is a series of exercises through which students develop their schema for mathematical thinking and&nbsp; reasoning via a structure process. The routine aims to…….
* Building understanding and memory with <b>Similar questions</b>
* Addressing <b>Misconceptions</b>
* Deepening concept knowledge with <b>Alternate Solutions</b>
* Decision making questions with <b>Right or Wrong</b>
* Build higher order thinking by allowing students to <b>Think &amp; Create</b>

<b><u>Math Enrichment</u></b>

*  E2K (P4 – P6)
*  Magic Math (P4-P5)
*  P5 Kite Construction
*  P5 Calculator Workshop
*  P4 Board Game Design
*  P3 International Chess Training

			E2K is a Mathematics enrichment programme for upper primary students who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics.<br>
			<br>
The programme comprises Mathematics curriculum units that are designed to challenge high-ability students and to introduce them to advanced Mathematics concepts and thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp; It fosters independence in mathematical thinking skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies such as creative and critical thinking and effective communication skills.<br>
			<br>
During the E2K sessions, students will be assigned challenging Mathematics problems. They will have opportunities to discover, reason and communicate mathematical ideas and concepts, especially in problem solving (games-based learning).

			Students experience real life application of mathematical&nbsp; knowledge as they apply their understanding of geometry in the process of constructing a kite. This event not only deepens mathematical understanding of students, but strengthens recall and process thinking skills through hands-on involvement in the kite construction. Apart from being engaging and fun, true joy is also elicited through seeing their newly constructed&nbsp; kite soar high in the sky.
