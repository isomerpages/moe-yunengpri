pupils to be confident communicators, creative thinkers, and effective
problem solvers.</p>

enhance learning, providing visual and exploratory environments where students
can connect with their Mother Tongue Language, culture, and values in meaningful
and interactive ways.</p>
<p>Through these programmes, our Mother Tongue Languages curriculum nurtures <strong>future-ready, confident, and culturally grounded learners</strong> who
are proficient in language and deeply appreciative of their heritage.</p>

<h4>The Yu Neng Difference</h4>
<p>Our <strong>MTL Curriculum @ Yu Neng</strong> emphasises:</p>
<p><strong>Strong Foundations through Purposeful Scaffolding</strong>
<br>Differentiated and progressive support to build core literacy, oral skills,
and learner confidence, e.g. MTL Fundamental, AI tools to reinforce, etc
<br>
<br><strong>Stretch Programmes to Challenge our students</strong>
<br>The Focused Dialogue Enrichment Programme provides pupils with an authentic
platform to develop their oral communication skills in Malay. Through planning,
scripting, recording, and reflecting on their dialogue, pupils learn to
express ideas clearly, articulate opinions confidently, and engage listeners
effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Integration of Language, Culture, and Values</strong>
<br>Experiential learning stations, authentic language and cultural immersion
through lessons, camps, and festive celebrations, e.g. Virtual Immersion
Program, etc</p>
<p><strong>Future-Ready and Digitally Enabled Learning</strong>
<br>Effective use of digital tools to engage learners and develop confident,
bilingual learners in a globalised world, e.g. SLS, wordwall, etc
<br>Through this balanced and inclusive approach, Yu Neng’s Mother Tongue
Languages curriculum aims to <strong>nurture confident and future-ready bilingual learners grounded in language, culture, values and innovation.</strong>
