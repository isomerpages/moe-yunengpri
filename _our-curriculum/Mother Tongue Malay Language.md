The Mother Tongue Fortnight provided students with an authentic learning of the Mother Tongue Languages through a wide range of cultural activities. Students learnt about songs, poetry and stories through drama and Dikir Barat. Traditional musical instruments such as Angklung and Kompang were also introduced.
