The Mother Tongue Fortnight provided students with an authentic learning of the Mother Tongue Languages through a wide range of cultural activities. Students learnt about songs, poetry and stories through drama and Dikir Barat. Traditional musical instruments such as Angklung and Kompang were also introduced. Students had fun participated in the traditional games. Screening of folklore stories and participating in games such as Pintar Kata (Smart in Vocabulary), Scrabble and Boggle encouraged the learning of vocabulary.
