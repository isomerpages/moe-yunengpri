Welcome and warmest greetings for 2022!

As we look forward to a new school year, my heart is filled with both gratitude and wonder, with a strong sense of pride in the many accomplishments and impact we are making to our community.

As we continue to rediscover and nurture Yu Neng’s brand of passion, creativity and care in developing our strength of will, strength of mind and strength of heart, we are also guided by a roadmap to embrace each of us in Yu Neng as _whole persons_: one with _passion_ to pursue life goals, _creativity_ to adapt and overcome challenges and _care_ for the community we belong to. Whole persons who have well-being at the heart of what they do. Indeed, well-being is important in all areas of life, but especially in young people’s development.

We know that young people feel well when they enjoy their learning, look forward to coming to school, and feel valued by their families and friends. We all want them to experience joy, to thrive physically and emotionally, and to have a voice in their learning and their future. Well-being brings us balance in the present. Wholeness pulls us towards the future. In a larger sense, wholeness comes from being in service to others and something larger than yourself. Ultimately, this is about each of us taking personal responsibility for realizing the wholeness of our vibrant connected community, centered on our purpose to nurture passionate learners, creative thinkers and caring leaders. It is also premised on each of us embracing self-care and wellbeing, so we can experience wholeness.

This year, as we journey ahead, we invite all our parents and partners to join us in the quest for wholeness, both within and beyond the school.  May we always find joy and contentment, meaning and purpose in all we do, while accepting the occasional disappointment and sadness.  For this is what wholeness beyond well-being is all about, a higher calling for all to aspire and live our lives.

Wishing all a blissful year together @ Yu Neng!

Yours in Education  
Mr Ng Yeow Ling
