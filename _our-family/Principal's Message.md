<h4><strong>Our Story Continues: A Mindful Journey Together</strong></h4>
<p>Welcome to a new chapter in the proud and purposeful journey of our school!
<br>
<br>Over nine decades, we have lived and breathed a legacy of educational
excellence, character development and community partnership, culminating
in our meaningful <strong>YN90 celebrations</strong> in 2025. These milestones
have strengthened our shared identity as a community that celebrates growth,
resilience and collective care.
<br>
<br>As we step confidently into 2026 and look ahead to the next five years, <em>our story continues</em> with
renewed clarity of purpose and a deeper commitment to nurturing every child
to thrive in an ever-changing world. Guided by our theme <strong>“A Mindful Journey Together,”</strong> our
Strategic Plans for <strong>2026–2030</strong> build on our strengths and
chart a course that honours our heritage while embracing the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vision for the Next Five Years</strong>
<br>We aspire to develop <strong>well-rounded, future-ready learners</strong> who
are grounded in strong values, empowered with 21st Century Competencies,
and connected to their community. In this mindful journey:
<br>
<br>• <strong>Every student learns with purpose and joy</strong> — engagement
and deep learning experiences remain central to our technology-enabled
curriculum.
<br>• <strong>Every student grows in character and confidence</strong> — through
values-infused programmes that develop respect, resilience, care and integrity.
<br>• <strong>Every student contributes with heart</strong> — through meaningful
service, leadership opportunities and community partnerships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Priorities 2026–2030</strong>
<br>Our Strategic Plans focus on three interwoven priorities that will guide
our collective work:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. Deepening Learning &amp; Innovation</strong>
<br>We will enrich teaching and learning practices with purposeful blended
digital and experiential learning that fosters curiosity and creativity.
Building on ongoing efforts such as our Applied Learning Programme and
multiliteracies initiatives, students will be supported to take ownership
of their learning and confidently engage with complex problems.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2. Strengthening Well-Being &amp; Mindful Practices</strong>
<br>Well-being is foundational to every child’s growth. We will integrate <em>mindful habits of heart and mind</em> into
school culture — nurturing self-awareness, empathy, resilience and a sense
of belonging across our community. This mindful journey supports our learners
to be grounded and balanced, even as they reach for new heights and flourish
as community changemakers as part of our Learn for Life programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3. Enriching Community Connections &amp; Impact</strong>
<br>Yu Neng is a vibrant connected community — of students, parents, staff,
alumni and partners. Together, we will expand opportunities for partnerships
that deepen learning, grow civic awareness and encourage meaningful contributions
beyond the school gates. Our partnerships will continue to strengthen home-school
collaboration and invite all stakeholders into the educational journey.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>A Shared Journey Forward</strong>
<br>Our strategic direction for 2026–2030 invites every member of the Yu Neng
family to walk this mindful path <em>together</em> — where every step forward
honours our shared values, elevates student agency, and contributes to
the common good. We remain committed to inclusivity, holistic development
and lifelong learning as we prepare our students not just for academic
success, but for purposeful lives in a rapidly evolving world.
<br>
<br>To our students — may your curiosity deepen; your courage expand; and
your kindness to others continue to shine. To our parents and partners
— thank you for your trust and partnership in nurturing the next generation.
And to our dedicated staff — thank you for your unwavering commitment to
excellence in learning and care.</p>
<p>Let us continue this mindful journey together — shaping hearts and minds,
and writing the next exciting chapter of our Yu Neng story.</p>
