<h4><strong>Yu Neng at 90: A Legacy of Growth, A Future of Promise</strong></h4>
<p>As we embark on the year 2025, we are filled with immense pride and joy
to welcome all to a momentous chapter in our school's history - the 90th
anniversary of Yu Neng Primary School. This year marks nine decades of
educational excellence, character building, and community service that
have defined our beloved institution. Since 1935, Yu Neng has stood as
a pillar of learning in Singapore, adapting and evolving with our nation's
progress. Our journey has been one of continuous growth, innovation, and
unwavering commitment to nurturing young minds. As we celebrate this milestone,
we reflect on our rich heritage while looking forward to the exciting future
that lies ahead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even as navigate the ever-changing landscape of education, let us draw
inspiration from the resilience and adaptability that have defined Yu Neng
for 90 years. May we continue to innovate in our teaching methods, foster
a love for learning in our students, and uphold the values that have been
the cornerstone of our institution. More than just teachers; we are custodians
of a legacy, mentors shaping the future, and key players in writing the
next chapter of Yu Neng's story. Our impact extends far beyond the classroom,
touching lives and inspiring generations. As we celebrate our past and
look to the future, let us reaffirm our commitment to excellence in education
and to nurturing every child who walks through our gates.</p>
