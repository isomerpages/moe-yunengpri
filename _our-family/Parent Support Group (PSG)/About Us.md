### ABOUT US

#### About Us

The Parent Support Group (PSG) provides parents opportunities to work hand-in-hand with the school to support their children in their education journey. Such parental involvement has a positive impact on a child’s overall development. Hence the&nbsp;***Yu Neng PSG***&nbsp;was formed in 2010.&nbsp; The Group is led by an&nbsp;***Executive Committee (Exco)***&nbsp;that collaborates closely with the school’s&nbsp;***Strategic Thrust 3 Committee (ST3)***&nbsp;in ensuring plans and initiatives are well-aligned to the PSG Mission and Objectives.&nbsp;

In November 2016, the fathers’ arm of the YNPSG was set up. Known as the&nbsp;**Yu Neng&nbsp;*Super Dads***, their aim is to promote greater father-child engagement, in line with the nation-wide Dads For Life movement. &nbsp;

#### Our Mission

To establish and nurture a close relationship with members of the school and&nbsp;fellow parents and create the best possible holistic learning environment for our children

#### Our Objectives

To strive towards the 3Cs:

1\.  **Collaboration**– Fostering meaningful partnerships with teachers through closer collaboration on school programmes and activities to attain the desired benefits for our children.
2\.  **Connect**– Creating opportunities for fellowship, mutual learning and sharing amongst parents, developing a trusting and understanding relationship with members of the school and supporting the emotional wellbeing of our children by connecting positively with them.&nbsp;
3\.  **Co-Create**&nbsp;– working hand-in-hand with the school to create new and engaging learning experiences through leveraging on the diverse skills, talents and ideas that our parents can share. &nbsp;
