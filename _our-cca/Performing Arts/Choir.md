The Yu Neng Primary School Choir was established in 2015 with the aim of promoting the use of voice to spread the joy of music to others. Choir provides a fun and supportive environment that motivates and inspires members to pursue their passion in choral singing.

Comprising of enthusiastic choristers, members are taught various singing techniques and are exposed to a wide repertoire of songs ranging from popular musicals and evergreen favourites to the classics. Members are provided with opportunities to develop their GR<sup>3</sup>IT values and hone their learning dispositions through the vibrant and enriching learning experiences.

Our caring choristers also use their vocal talents to reach out and make a difference to the community. They have performed at various local and international such as ChildAid 2018, at Tokyo, Japan, the SG200 commemoration concert “We Love You! Little Red Dot” amongst many others.
