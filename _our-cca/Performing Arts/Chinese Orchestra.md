The Chinese Orchestra aims to nurture students into passionate individuals with a life-long passion for music and the arts. Through sectionals, combined practices, various school-wide and external performances, students learn the important of teamwork as they play different instruments in the orchestra and develop understanding of music elements, concepts and techniques to play the various instruments in the orchestra. Through the learning process, students will also further develop the GR<sup>3</sup>IT values.
