In Contemporary Dance CCA, we strive to develop students’ movement skills, musicality and creativity. Through our weekly sessions, the students will develop a love and appreciation for contemporary dance. The sessions and the activities also serve as platforms to inculcate the GR<sup>3</sup>IT values. Contemporary Dance provides students with an alternative way to express and to communicate their ideas, encouraging independent and creative thinking. Important social and emotional skills, such as taking turns, sharing attention and working in a team, are also imparted in the learning of contemporary dance.
