Yu Neng Primary School’s Malay Dance aims to expose members to a repertoire of traditional Malay dances such as the Asli, Inang, Joget and Zapin. Through this CCA, our dancers gain confidence while performing and showcasing their talent. It also imbues the values of commitment and perseverance.

Various platforms are given to the dancers to showcase their capabilities and strengths in the performing arts, both during school and external events.&nbsp;These will test members’ dance technique, skills, collaboration, synergy, teamwork, commitment, discipline and dedication. It will also give members a sense of achievement, fulfillment and satisfaction of their dance ability and various other skills required. Events like these will give invaluable experience and achievement points to the selected members. Apart from all that, closer bonds can ultimately be forged between senior and junior dancers through frequent practices as well.

In line with our school values, GR3IT, our dancers grow together in&nbsp;keeping traditional Malay dance alive.
