E-nnovation Club strives to nurture successful innovators of tomorrow. Through the CCA, the students will have opportunities to be developed into creative thinkers and confident communicators. Students will be involved in projects that require them to work in teams, find solutions to problems, where they will need to think out of the box, and convey their ideas effectively. The activities thus requires students to be innovative and creative. Furthermore, students get to experience coding, creation of games and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
