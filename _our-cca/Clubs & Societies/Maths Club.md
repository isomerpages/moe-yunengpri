The Math Club – Recreational CCA provides opportunities for students to enjoy a variety of customized resources, which includes puzzles (such as Sudoku), quizzes, riddles, math games and Koobits (e-learning). These opportunities thus aim to develop the students’ cognitive, social and emotional skills where they collaboratively work on the problem solving activities. These activities can also develop their logical thinking and reasoning skills.

The objectives of the CCA are to:

Create opportunities for students to have fun while learning Mathematics;

Develop students’ logical thinking and their reasoning skills; and

Promote teamwork and working with others.
