The Art Club offers students with a shared interest in visual arts to come together and to express themselves through various art media and forms of art-making.&nbsp;

The Art Club provides a platform for students to build on their talent while exploring different art forms and experiment with both traditional and modern mediums. Students can look forward to learning journeys to museums and exhibitions that can help in sharpening the students’ appreciation and awareness of art around them. Students are also given opportunities to showcase their talents via art competitions and exhibitions like the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition. Students can look forward to seeing their creative ideas come to life.
