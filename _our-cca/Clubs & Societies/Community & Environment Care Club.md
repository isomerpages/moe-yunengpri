Yu Neng Community and Environmental Care Club (CECC) provides opportunities to cultivate the spirit of scientific inquiry and innovation in the students. It also aims to promote science interests and engagement through challenging and mind-stretching tasks.

During Science week, Yu Neng CECC members will also share and educate their peers about the different Science concepts they have learnt. In addition, through the collaboration with the Singapore Nature Society, where they learnt about the tracking of Flora and Fauna in our eco-garden, CECC members gain awareness of the importance of biodiversity conservation in Singapore. The students also have the opportunity to grow their own crops, learn about weeding as well as green tips on how to care for plants. To pay it forward, they also engage in community outreach programmes.

<u>The objectives of CECC are to:</u>

Gain insights of important science concepts and to present these science concepts to their peers throughpre-morning assembly sessions and other platforms;

Gain an awareness of the importance of biodiversity conservation in Singapore, such that they will eventually contribute to a greener Earth; and

Cultivate the spirit of scientific inquiry and innovation.
