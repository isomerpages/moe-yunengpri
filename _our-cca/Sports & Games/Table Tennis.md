Table tennis is one of the four sports CCAs in Yu Neng Primary School. The team has won numerous accolades at the zonal and national levels over the years. We hope to cultivate their love for Table Tennis in every member as well as to develop their skills and their physical fitness.

With the infusion of the YN GR3IT values, Table Tennis CCA provides opportunities for students to become good sportsmen/women and develop their character, leadership and social and emotional skills. Students will learn to cooperate with one another, work together towards a common goal and respond appropriately in moments of victory and defeat. Through the CCA, students will also grow in virtues like courage, integrity, resilience and humility.
