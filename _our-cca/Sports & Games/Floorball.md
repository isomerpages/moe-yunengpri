As one of the sports CCA, Floorball trainings aims to inculcate GR<sup>3</sup>IT values and develop every student holistically. Through our training sessions and exposure to competitive games in the Nationals, we empower our students with leadership opportunities, develop a robust team spirit and foster a positive and winning mentality resulting in resilient players.

Through the post-training reflections, students will gain a deeper knowledge and appreciation for the sport and better understanding of themselves. Furthermore, students will contribute to the communities within the school and the neighborhood through the various programmes such as Values in Action programme and Mentoring programme. With our teachers’ determination, our students’ perseverance and the support from our school leaders and supportive parents, Floorball CCA will produce students who will light up and shine.
