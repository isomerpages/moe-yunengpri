Volleyball is one of the four sports CCA offered at Yu Neng. It strives to offer every student opportunities to develop their interests as well as their skills. Through the trainings and competitions, Volleyball students will develop the studentsâ€™ character and inculcate GR<sup>3</sup>IT values that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world.

In addition, the regular trainings will develop their social and emotional skills where they will grow in friendships that will lead to greater integration within the school community. Hence, students will be developed holistically.
