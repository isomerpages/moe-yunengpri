<h4>Power @ YNPS</h4>
<p>Learning dispositions, or habits of learning, are the different characteristics
with which children approach the learning process. Some have referred to
dispositions as “enduring habits of mind and action; the tendency to respond
to situations in characteristic ways” (Aistear, 2009, p.54). A child’s
disposition to learning affects the attitude with which they learn. This,
in turn, directly affects the effort that they are willing to put in. Cultivating
positive learning dispositions goes a long way to creating positive learning
outcomes.</p>
<h4>Encouraging Positive Learning Dispositions in Students</h4>
<p>We are committed to helping our students understand that different habits
and ways of thinking can make learning easier. At Yu Neng Primary School,
we have identified four key learning dispositions we will focus on, namely
Reflectiveness and Readiness (categorised as habits of mind); Resourcefulness
and Relatedness (categorised as habits of action). <em>The first disposition under each category, Reflectiveness and Readiness, take on the personal dimension, while the second set takes on the team dimension.All four dispositions are equally important. We can only be effective learners when we have developed both habits of mind and action, along with the personal and team dimensions, as learning is both a personal and social undertaking.</em>

<h4>Introducing Positive Learning Dispositions into the Classroom</h4>
<p>Teachers are encouraged to plan learning experiences that help children
acquire skills and the disposition to use those skills. We have designed
these visuals to facilitate related processes during lessons. &nbsp;Our
goal is to foster a positive classroom environment and help students be
the best learners they can be!</p>
