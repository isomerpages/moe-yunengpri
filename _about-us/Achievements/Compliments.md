<p>Dear teachers and Ms Alicia,
<br>
<br>Both of my children Dylan Wu and Claire Wu have transferred to Yu Neng
Primary School for a month. I am very pleased that they are settling in
very well, and enjoying the learning journey very much so far. I would
like to thank all the teachers and CCA coaches who interacted with them
for the kind support and guidance given to them.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I also wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank Ms Alicia Tan Ee Kia
for all the assistance you provided to me during the school transfer process.
You made a significant difference for us during the very stressful time
while we were overwhelmed with many other matters happening altogether,
and we truly appreciate your kindness and dedication. From helping me gather
the necessary documents to offering valuable advice, you went above and
beyond to ensure everything went smoothly. Your patience, understanding,
and willingness to help did not go unnoticed, and we are genuinely grateful
for all the time and effort you invested in making this smooth transition
for my children and our family.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Thank you again to all the teachers at Yu Neng Primary School for everything.
Your invaluable roles will definitely influence the children and the inspiring
culture will stay with them for years to come.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Best regards,
<br>Shirley&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’d like to express our appreciation for the great work Mrs Sally Chew
has done so far. Beyond the academic aspects, she has shown strong awareness
and care for our child's overall well-being, including social and emotional
development. We’re especially grateful for her attentiveness and thoughtful
communication. Her supportive approach has made a positive difference for
our child and for us as parents.

<p>As a parent, I was truly inspired. Beyond academic achievements, what
we hope for our children is to grow up with integrity, resilience, and
a strong sense of service. I believe events like the Prefects Investiture
provide students with invaluable life lessons, while also instilling in
them a deep sense of national identify and shared responsibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a world that is rapidly changing, it is comforting to know that our
children are learning and growing in an education system that values character,
leadership, and heart. Please accept my heartfelt thanks to all educators
and school leaders who continue to guide our children with wisdom, empathy,
and unwavering commitment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Warmest regards,
<br>Wang Yimin
<br>Parent of a student at Yu Neng Primary</p>

<p>I would like to compliment Mr Firdaus for his fervour of the children
under his care. He has been instrumental in providing my child with special
needs the unwavering support that he needs to thrive in school.
<br>
<br>Many a times, he has gone beyond his work to contact us in the evenings
to update us. His care has seen my child flourish though there is still
much to be done.</p>
<p>
<br>We like to praise and compliment him for his hard work and dedication.

<p>Mr Cai is the co-form teacher of my child in 2 teamwork.
<br>
<br>As a child with special needs, he was never an easy child to teach and
he struggled with learning mandarin in P1. He had problems recognising
Chinese words and we resort to rote learning to get him to learn for Chinese
spelling.
<br>
<br>Of late, he is more proactive, often asking me to tell him the word behind
the shapes he described. Yesterday he blew his allowance to buy MT Textbook
for H2 2025. He reasoned that he wants to learn new words.
<br>
<br>Without doubt, Mr Cai had a big impact on his transformation. My son kept
rambling about Mr Cai sharing of "Journey to the West" in class. I offered
to find them on YouTube for him but he said that he prefer it to be in
Mr Cai's class. All I can say i "Good Job, Mr Cai and thank you for your
Good Teaching."</p>
