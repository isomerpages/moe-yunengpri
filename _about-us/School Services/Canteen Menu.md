The school strives to provide a balanced and healthy meal for all students. Besides the meals offered above, some canteen stall holders may also sell other food items, such as sushi roll, puffs, and sandwiches. This aims to provide more variety for students, while still ensuring item sold is nutritious and appropriate for our students.
