<p>YN89 marks a special point in time for all Yu Neng students and staff.
Riding off the wave of YN88 celebrations, which centred on the YN88 Art
Collection <strong>育能八十八 书画美展 </strong>and YN88 book publication, With All
My Voice <strong>育能八十八 倾听我心,</strong> led by YN Alumni Association and School
Advisory Committee, supported by parents, partners, staff and students,
YN89 will continue to tell of the other stories of the Yu Neng community
past and future, culminating in our YN90 celebrations in 2025.</p>
<p>Our changemaker students from P2, P4 and P6 of 2024 will come together
as a cohort to present their gifts to the school for YN89. &nbsp;Students
will reflect on their journey with Yu Neng and put forth their gratitude
to the communities who had supported them, as well as their well-wishes
and aspirations for themselves and their juniors, anchoring on rich learning
gleaned from education received in Yu Neng in areas of technology and language
acquisition. Do look out for these upcoming celebratory activities!</p>
