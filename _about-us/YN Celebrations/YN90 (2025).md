<p>We are excited to share that we will have our different levels of students
present their gift to the school, similar to our celebrations for YN88
and YN89. Some key highlights will be our students coming together through
sports and movement to attempt to break a Singapore Book of Records through
teamwork and the Yu Neng Grit Spirit as part of Children’s Day and YN90
celebrations. Our P4 cohort will also be involved in our inaugural cohort
concert where every one of them will participate through song or dance
in a specially choreographed musical that same evening. We have invited
past and present friends, alumnus, parents, staff members and partners
as we gather the whole community in difference making through the concert
and a mid-autumn and homecoming celebrations where all who have been part
of the Yu Neng story can connect and continue to shape Yu Neng into a vibrant
and caring community for all.</p>

<h4><strong>Primary 6 Class of 2025 Marks 90th Anniversary in a Symbolic Formation</strong></h4>
<p>
<br>In a heartwarming display of unity and school spirit, the Primary 6 students
of the Class of 2025 came together with the school staff to form the number
"90" in celebration of the school's 90th anniversary. This momentous occasion
not only commemorates the rich history of the school but also serves as
a powerful testament that every staff member and student play an integral
role in shaping its legacy.
<br>
</p>
<p>As the staff and students stood together in formation, they embodied the
spirit of teamwork, perseverance, and belonging - qualities that have defined
the school for nearly a century. This act of solidarity reflects the school's
deep commitment to fostering a nurturing environment where every individual
is valued, and every contribution is recognised. Through this formation,
the Primary 6 Class of 2025 has not only paid tribute to the school's past
but has also set an inspiring example for future generations to continue
upholding its legacy.</p>

<p>In celebration of Yu Neng's 90-year legacy, the Parent Support Group (PSG)
launched the sale of the YN90 Bears in April 2025. These adorable commemorative
bears are more than just cuddly companions – they are symbols of nine decades
of excellence and community spirit!</p>
<p>The heartwarming initiative launched by the PSG was met with overwhelmingly
good response from parents and staff. We are delighted to announce that
the PSG has raised a total of $6,000 for our four charitable partners -
Willing Hearts, Food from the Heart, SPCA, and Cerebral Palsy Alliance
Singapore (CPAS) respectively.</p>
<p>Thank you one and all for your generosity... it has not only helped us
commemorate Yu Neng's 90th anniversary but has also made a meaningful impact
in our community.</p>
<p>This wonderful achievement truly embodies the Yu Neng spirit of caring
and giving, and changemaking. We are grateful to all parents and supporters
who participated in this meaningful initiative. Together, we have shown
that the Yu Neng family extends beyond our school gates, touching lives
and making a difference in our community.</p>
