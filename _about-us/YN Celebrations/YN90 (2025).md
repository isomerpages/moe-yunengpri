<p>We are excited to share that we will have our different levels of students
present their gift to the school, similar to our celebrations for YN88
and YN89. Some key highlights will be our students coming together through
sports and movement to attempt to break a Singapore Book of Records through
teamwork and the Yu Neng Grit Spirit as part of Childrenâ€™s Day and YN90
celebrations. Our P4 cohort will also be involved in our inaugural cohort
concert where every one of them will participate through song or dance
in a specially choreographed musical that same evening. We have invited
past and present friends, alumnus, parents, staff members and partners
as we gather the whole community in difference making through the concert
and a mid-autumn and homecoming celebrations where all who have been part
of the Yu Neng story can connect and continue to shape Yu Neng into a vibrant
and caring community for all.</p>
