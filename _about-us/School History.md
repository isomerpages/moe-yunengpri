### SCHOOL HISTORY


In 1934, the late Mr Ng Huay Leng, along with 4 humble villagers, took upon themselves the responsibility of nurturing and educating the young. With meagre resources, they managed to build a zinc and attap school and called it Yeu Nerng School. Conducting lessons in Mandarin and dialect, Yeu Nerng catered to 20 students from the neighbouring villages. Despite poverty and difficult times, the students of Yeu Nerng achieved commendable examination results.

&nbsp;After the Japanese Occupation, the restoration of the school once again confirmed the undying spirit of selfless dedication. 
There were two other principals who headed the school then, namely Mr Zheng Zhao Wu and Mr Lin Qin Rong till 1959.
 
By 1960, the school had an enrollment of about hundred pupils. The enrolment grew to about 693 in 1978 with a staff strength of 23 teachers. With a committed new management committee, Yeu Nerng grew to become a 9-classroom, double-session school. Over the years, the school had consistently managed an overall percentage of passes above the National Average in the Primary School Leaving Examination.

Yeu Nerng Public School continued to grow from strength to strength. In 1982, it moved to the site at Bedok North Street 3 to cater to its rapidly expanding population. The school also changed its status from an aided to a government school and was renamed “Yu Neng Primary School”. English was adopted as the school’s main language medium in the curriculum. In January 2003, the school went through PRIME upgrading and had to move to a temporary holding site. During this period, the school merged with Min Xin Primary School. In 2005, the school moved back to its current school building at Bedok North Street 3 and was officially reopened in July 2006.

Through the years, Yu Neng Primary School has maintained the traits and virtues of its early founders. 2015 will be a significant year for the school as it commemorates its 80th anniversary. With its rich history, strong foundation, values and beliefs, Yu Neng continues to grow and strive towards its motto of “Light Up and Shine”.

#### OUR 80TH ANNIVERSARY

Yu Neng celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2015, the same year that Singapore celebrates its Golden Jubilee. Celebrations began at the end of 2014 with the YN80 Kick-off Carnival held in November. In celebration of this historic occasion, the School hosted its 80th Anniversary Dinner at the Yu Neng Pri School Hall on Sat 25 July 2015. Gracing the dinner as the Guest-of-Honour was then&nbsp;Minister for Education, Mr Heng Swee Keat who launched&nbsp;the i-Gallery@YNPS.&nbsp;The i-Gallery aims to engage and promote awareness and appreciation of Yu Neng’s school history alongside that of the Bedok community and our nation. Supported by the National Heritage Board, it also features the contributions and inputs of the Alumni, Parent Support Group, staff, pupils, stakeholders and community partners.

The commemorative YN80 book was launched on 12 April to mark Yu Neng’s 80 years of inspiring and enabling education. (Please click on the link [YN 80 Book](https://bit.ly/3DVczWF)) Finally, to round up the year-long celebration of this momentous occasion, Yu Neng embarked on a ‘Pay-it-Forward’ Values-in-Action (VIA) project&nbsp;in&nbsp;collaboration with strategic partners The Business Times and The RICE Co Ltd.&nbsp;The school came together for a mass sewing session of the SGBears on 3 August. With the support of strategic partners, parents, staff and many others, the school managed to raise $110,000 for ChildAid Asia as Cogent Holdings bought all the bears made by pupils and staff. Our parents also supported the school throughout the process. They cut the cloths, sorted them out, sewed some of the bears and were also present on the day to help our pupils.

#### THE SCHOOL BELL

The bell (currently in the school hall) was donated to the school by Mr Ng Hong Kok and his brothers after the Japanese Occupation.&nbsp;It was used by the school to signify the start of school, recess and dismissal till the 1980s. It was kept in store until it was displayed at the i-Gallery in 2015.&nbsp;

Since reallocating in September 2016, the school rung the school bell to signify important school events and celebration of individual or team achievements.
