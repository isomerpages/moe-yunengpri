In 1934, the late Mr Ng Huay Leng, along with 4 humble villagers, took upon themselves the responsibility of nurturing and educating the young. With meagre resources, they managed to build a zinc and attap school and called it Yeu Nerng School. Conducting lessons in Mandarin and dialect, Yeu Nerng catered to 20 students from the neighbouring villages. Despite poverty and difficult times, the students of Yeu Nerng achieved commendable examination results.

&nbsp;After the Japanese Occupation, the restoration of the school once again confirmed the undying spirit of selfless dedication. 
There were two other principals who headed the school then, namely Mr Zheng Zhao Wu and Mr Lin Qin Rong till 1959.
 
By 1960, the school had an enrollment of about hundred pupils. The enrolment grew to about 693 in 1978 with a staff strength of 23 teachers. With a committed new management committee, Yeu Nerng grew to become a 9-classroom, double-session school. Over the years, the school had consistently managed an overall percentage of passes above the National Average in the Primary School Leaving Examination.

Yeu Nerng Public School continued to grow from strength to strength. In 1982, it moved to the site at Bedok North Street 3 to cater to its rapidly expanding population. The school also changed its status from an aided to a government school and was renamed “Yu Neng Primary School”. English was adopted as the school’s main language medium in the curriculum. In January 2003, the school went through PRIME upgrading and had to move to a temporary holding site. During this period, the school merged with Min Xin Primary School. In 2005, the school moved back to its current school building at Bedok North Street 3 and was officially reopened in July 2006.

#### THE SCHOOL BELL

The bell (currently in the school hall) was donated to the school by Mr Ng Hong Kok and his brothers after the Japanese Occupation.&nbsp;It was used by the school to signify the start of school, recess and dismissal till the 1980s. It was kept in store until it was displayed at the YN Gallery in 2015.&nbsp;

Since relocating in September 2016, the school rung the school bell to signify important school events and celebration of individual or team achievements.
